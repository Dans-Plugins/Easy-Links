# Easy Links Configuration

A `config.yml` is generated in `plugins/EasyLinks/` on first run.

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `version` | String | *(plugin version)* | Plugin version. Do not edit manually. |
| `debugMode` | Boolean | `false` | Enables verbose debug logging to the console. |
| `usage-reporting.enabled` | Boolean | `true` | Whether the plugin reports usage events (see below). Set to `false` to turn it off. |
| `usage-reporting.endpoint` | String | `https://trace.danielstephenson.dev` | The trace server events are sent to. |
| `usage-reporting.key` | String | the plugin's key | Identifies this plugin to the trace server so reports are attributed to it. Not a secret: it ships in the default config and can only report as EasyLinks. Empty means reporting is off regardless of `enabled`. |

## Usage reporting

When the plugin is enabled, and each time one of its commands is used, a small event is sent to the
author's [trace](https://github.com/Stephenson-Software/trace-client-java) server so it is known which
plugins are actually in use. An event carries the plugin's name, the event name (`startup` or
`command`), and either the plugin version or the command name — nothing about players, the world, or
the server. Sending happens off the main thread, never delays a tick, and is dropped silently if the
server cannot be reached. Set `usage-reporting.enabled` to `false` to turn it off.

A `config.yml` written by a version before usage reporting existed has no `usage-reporting` block.
The plugin reads the bundled defaults for any key the file lacks, so reporting is active on such a
server too until `usage-reporting.enabled` is set to `false`; the block is written out in full the
next time the plugin version changes.
